Tiger Highlighting Support Files for Visual Studio 2008
F.R.C.

1. Copy "usertype.dat" to "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE", supposed that you install VS in the default directory. If there is one (nVidia Cg uses the same approach), just open both in the notepad, and merge them.

2. Merge tiger.reg into the registry.

Then you can open .tig file directly from explorer and it will appear in the VS with highlighted keywords.
Notice that C keywords are also highlighted, but this will not be a problem.

VS2005 may use the same approach, with some modification in the registry path.
